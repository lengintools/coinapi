== A brief Markdown Example ==

Here's how you can use Markdown to format your plugin's readme file:

### Headers

Use `#` for headers. More `#`s mean a smaller header.

### Lists

- For unordered lists, use dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`).
- For ordered lists, simply number them.

### Links

Here's a link to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") and one to [Markdown's Syntax Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file").

### Code

Use backticks to `highlight` code snippets. Use triple backticks for blocks of code.
